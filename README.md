## Overview

<img width="80%" alt="" src="./docs/assets/screencapture_1.png">

Celluloid is a collaborative video annotation application designed for educational purposes.

With Celluloid, you can find a [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) video, select an educational objective, annotate the video, share it with your students, collect their answers, and respond to their questions.

## ‚ú® Demo

Visit https://celluloid.huma-num.fr/, create an account, and start using Celluloid.
We value your feedback on the application's user experience and design. If you encounter any bugs or issues, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/celluloid-camp/celluloid/issues).

## Development Team

Celluloid originated from a research project led by **Micha√´l Bourgatte** and **Laurent Tessier**, two senior lecturers at the [Catholic University of Paris](https://en.icp.fr/english-version/). Their work focuses on educational science and digital humanities.
Celluloid is currently maintained by [Younes Benaomar](https://github.com/younes200), and we actively encourage contributions and involvement from the community. Feel free to reach out to us on [Discussions](https://github.com/celluloid-camp/celluloid/discussions).

# Setup

## Prerequisites

### Environment

Celluloid is designed to run on a Linux server. Proficiency with the command-line interface is necessary for deployment and installation. It's highly recommended to use an OSX or Linux workstation.

### üî® Tools

- Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install the latest version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and use it instead of NPM. 

The project is organized as a [monorepo](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/02/23/javascript-monorepos.html), so Yarn is required to leverage [Yarn workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/).

```


### üì¶ Database

You will need a working [PostgreSQL server](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-install.html), version 13 or later.

We provide a complete docker compose [stack.yml](stack.yml) ready to run :

```bash
docker compose -f stack.yml up
```

### üì¨ Emails

A functioning SMTP server is necessary for sending account confirmation emails.
we've configured Nodemailer to use [ethereal.email](https://ethereal.email) to catch all development emails, and regular SMTP in production (easy to replace with a different provider thanks to Nodemailer)

### üóÇÔ∏è Storage

You are required to supply an S3-compatible storage service. For this purpose, we have set up the project to utilize [Minio](https://min.io/).


## Installation from Source

### Initial steps

Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/celluloid-camp/celluloid.git
cd celluloid/
yarn
```

### Configuration

Copy the sample environment file:

```bash
cp env.sample .env
```

Open the newly created .env file with your preferred text editor and configure the values according to your requirements.

### Development Mode

For development purposes, you can use the provided Docker Compose [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and run the command:

At the root of your repository, run the projet in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will initiate an interactive build and open the app in a browser window while continuously monitoring source files for modifications.
If everything worked without errors, you should be all set. Otherwise, please review the instructions above carefully.

### Production Mode

Build and start the application:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

You can access your app at http://localhost:3000.

### Building and starting the application as a docker Container

Open a terminal at the repository's root and run:

```bash
docker build -t  celluloid:latest -f Dockerfile.compact .
```

[Minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/container/index.html) is used for storage, make sure to run local instance or use external service and don't forget to update your [.env](.env.sample) file
